A new Flutter project.

## Flutter Clock

Welcome to Coffmann Flutter Clock : simple, basically made of icons of material.dart and text. I tried to be resourceful in the building of this clock.

A clock is one of the very few important things in our day to day life and I feel to a large entent, it is very much underrated. we look at it like "its just time", but this is responsible for a handful of the decisions we make.

inspiration for my clock is simplicity of a clock generally, the simpler the better.
gradient of a color was used to fell the scope of change as time changes.

I decided not to use font and images, tried as much as possible not to violate rules, you never can tell which image or resources has a copyright or not. 

Although very new to flutter, i decided to play around the animation and I must say flutter is accomodating.

I would prefer this to be tested on an andriod device.

### Me

started the journey in flutter in less than two months and 
I am enjoying it.
